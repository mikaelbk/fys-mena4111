	\section{Derive the Kohn Sham equation and explain each step in the derivations. You do not have to describe the functional derivatives since you already done that for the Hartree equation}
	
	\section{Assume we have the exact, true exchange-correlation functional $E_{xc}[n]$}
	\subsection{What material properties can we calculate exact with the Kohn-Sham equation}
	\subsection{What material properties may not be exactly described by the Kohn-Sham equation}
